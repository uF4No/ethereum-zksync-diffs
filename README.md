# Ethereum - ZKsync diffs

This repo contains two sample projects with the same smart contracts, deployment script and a script to interact with the contract.

- The `/ETH-demo` project is a Hardhat project configured to deploy on the Sepolia testnet.

- The `/ZK-demo` project simply adds the required plugin and configuration parameters to deploy on ZKsync Sepolia testnet.
